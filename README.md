 # Repository-Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
This project is to build an application encouraging the users to stay active, enjoy the fresh air and sunshine found on the top of the mountain. Camping is an excellent way to burn a ton of calories while doing some great activites and feeling healthier. The application will be created as a MERN stack single-page application in which the users will be able to browse through the different Camping packages and add the package or remove the package before checkout. Stripe payment platform will be used for the users to pay for the package. Contact Form will be used for the users to contact MERN Sky Camp Team in case of cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances or other enquiries.
