 # Repository-Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
This project is to build an application encouraging the users to stay active, enjoy the fresh air and sunshine found on the top of the mountain. Camping is an excellent way to burn a ton of calories while doing some great activites and feeling healthier. The application will be created as a MERN stack single-page application in which the users will be able to browse through the different Camping packages and add the package or remove the package before checkout. Stripe payment platform will be used for the users to pay for the package. Contact Form will be used for the users to contact MERN Sky Camp Team in case of cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances or other enquiries.

## Installation
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
The MERN stack has a three-layer architecture based on Model-View-Controller pattern and each interconnected layer performs a specific function in the application and this application is a MERN stack application which is a group of four technologies:-

React JS for the front end, that is, the client (View) in which the user inputs data and the data display,
GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server for the method called to store and retrieve data,
MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for the database (Model) to store raw data and contains no logic.

As a start and at the command prompt, type in npm install to ensure all that the dependencies are installed.

Before deploying to Heroku, the application is run in develop mode and tested using GraphQL by entering at command prompt:-

npm run seed

npm run develop ( cd to the correct directory)
